[Refer to my RGB-LED-Controller software here](https://github.com/intervenience/RGB-LED-Controller)

The colour picker was edited to suit my project, and was originally made (by judah4 and can be found here.)[https://github.com/judah4/HSV-Color-Picker-Unity]

The UI backgrounds are (by Kenney)[https://kenney.nl/]
